# Email Integration for Payment Notifications - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The email integration has been successfully implemented for PhonePe payment notifications. The system automatically sends email notifications to both users and administrators when payments are completed.

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Email Service** (`/server/services/emailService.js`)
- **Complete email service** with Nodemailer integration
- **HTML email templates** for professional-looking notifications
- **Multiple notification types**: Success, Failure, Admin alerts
- **Error handling** and logging
- **Connection verification** and testing capabilities

### 2. **PhonePe Integration** (`/server/services/phonepeService.js`)
- **Automatic email triggers** on payment completion
- **Webhook processing** with email notifications
- **Payment verification** with email follow-up
- **Support for both success and failure scenarios**

### 3. **API Endpoints** (`/server/routes/payments.js`)
- `POST /api/payments/test-email` - Test email configuration
- `POST /api/payments/send-notification` - Manual email sending
- `GET /api/payments/email-status` - Check email service status
- `POST /api/payments/callback` - Enhanced webhook with email support

### 4. **Email Templates**
- **User Payment Success**: Beautiful confirmation with order details
- **Admin Payment Notification**: Urgent action alerts for new orders
- **Payment Failure**: User-friendly failure notifications with retry options

## 🚀 How It Works

### Payment Flow with Email Notifications:
```
1. User completes payment via PhonePe
2. PhonePe sends webhook to /api/payments/callback
3. System verifies payment and extracts order data
4. Email notifications sent automatically:
   ✉️  User gets payment confirmation
   ✉️  Admin gets new order notification
5. Both emails contain relevant order and payment details
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Setup

### 1. Environment Variables (`.env` file in `/server/`)
```env
# Email Service Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Admin Email
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@roshinisshop.com

# Client URL (for email links)
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. For Gmail Setup:
1. Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account Settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Create password for "Mail"
3. Use this app password as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### Method 1: API Testing
```bash
# Check email service status
curl http://localhost:5003/api/payments/email-status

# Test email configuration (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5003/api/payments/test-email \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Send manual notification (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5003/api/payments/send-notification \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \\
  -d '{
    "orderNumber": "TEST-12345",
    "customerName": "John Doe",
    "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
    "amount": 2499,
    "transactionId": "TXN-67890"
  }'
```

### Method 2: Test Script
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test script
cd server
node test-email.js
```

### Method 3: PhonePe Webhook Simulation
```bash
# Simulate PhonePe webhook for testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:5003/api/payments/callback \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "merchantId": "TEST_MERCHANT",
    "merchantTransactionId": "ORDER-123",
    "transactionId": "TXN-456",
    "amount": 249900,
    "paymentState": "COMPLETED",
    "responseCode": "SUCCESS",
    "customerName": "Test User",
    "customerEmail": "test@example.com"
  }'
```

## 🔧 Production Considerations

### 1. **Email Service Providers**
- **Development**: Gmail with App Password
- **Production**: Consider SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
- **High Volume**: Dedicated SMTP services

### 2. **Security**
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Enable 2FA for email accounts
- Use App Passwords instead of regular passwords
- Implement rate limiting for email APIs

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Email failures don't block payment processing
- Comprehensive error logging
- Retry mechanisms for failed emails
- Fallback notification methods

### 4. **Template Management**
- Templates are embedded in code for simplicity
- Consider external template files for easier editing
- Support for multiple languages
- Brand customization options

## 📊 Monitoring and Logs

### Server Logs Show:
```
